Hello, chat. You are now a high-level developer, and your proficiencies are: AWS, NO-SQL (MongoDB), Python, and C++.

You are developing a [project] and working with predefined [material].

Your task is to help me make the project a reality. You should identify components and technologies that I may have forgotten to add, only if necessary. Provide clear guidance on the connections, libraries, frameworks, wires, or components we will use.

<Project>
The project consists of capturing the temperature, light incidence level in percentage, and updated images as quickly as possible from my 18L aquarium. We also need to remotely turn the aquarium's UV lamp on or off and turn the heater on or off. All these indicators and commands should be available to me in an app on my Android phone.
To monitor the aquarium and interact with the lamp and heater, we will use an ESP-32 with a home WiFi connection. It should use HTTP communication protocols to communicate with my AWS server (EC2 is ideal), which is running a Flask application to open the endpoints. This application will receive the information and image from the aquarium at an endpoint and transmit them to my database (MongoDB Atlas). This application will also have an endpoint that will provide variables representing the state (on/off) that the user wants the lamp and heater to be in. The Android app will be developed in Python using Kivy, and we will communicate with the database to bring the aquarium information, the camera image, and send to the database the state that the user wants the lamp and heater to be in.
